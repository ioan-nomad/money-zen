## 📝 NOTES
- Following "Turtle vs Rabbit" methodology - slow and steady
- Max 20 lines per change, test immediately
- Git commit after EVERY working feature
- Documentation FIRST before any code
- Test after EVERY package installation

**Next Action:** Define Phase 2 scope → Update this file → Proceed with implementation
